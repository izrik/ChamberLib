LGPL notice in source files.

regularize geometry
    normalize directions in the constructor
    fix other parameters in the constructor (e.g. Plane's distance is non-negative)
    Intersect() should return the actual intersection point, rather than some synthetic parameter

shader programs and stages
    extract uniform names from shader stages
    extract uniform names from all shader stages of a shader program
    extract bind attributes automatically? (the extra parameter to MakeShaderProgram makes caching tricky)
