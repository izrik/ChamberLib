LGPL notice in source files.

regularize geometry
    normalize directions in the constructor
    fix other parameters in the constructor (e.g. Plane's distance is non-negative)
    Intersect() should return the actual intersection point, rather than some synthetic parameter

shader programs and stages
    extract uniform names from shader stages
    extract uniform names from all shader stages of a shader program
    extract bind attributes automatically? (the extra parameter to MakeShaderProgram makes caching tricky)

clarify Overrides semantics
    e.g., if both Material and ShaderProgram are set, do we override the material and ignore the ShaderProgram setting? or do we override both material and shader?
